Hi, there! This is Ye Chen, a first-year PhD student advised by [Prof. Bingbing Ni](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=eUbmKwYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) from School of SEIEE, [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). Previously, I received Master and Bachelor degree from the same university with honor, supervised by Prof. Ning Liu and [Prof. Bingbing Ni](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=eUbmKwYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I have published several papers on leading journals and conferences, e.g., CVPR, ICCV, AAAI, and T-PAMI. My research interest lies in the intersection between Graphics, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning, especially includes 2D/3D AIGC and AI for Physics.
